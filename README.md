## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular architecture with these key components:

- **src/components**: Reusable UI components
- **src/screens**: Main application screens
- **src/context**: Context providers for themes, language, etc.
- **src/config**: Configuration and service files
- **src/theme**: Theme definitions and styling
- **src/assets**: Images, sounds, and other static resources

## Technical Implementation

### State Management

- React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo)
- Context API for global state (themes, language)
- Efficient re-rendering control

### Storage and Data

- AsyncStorage for persistent data
- Firebase Firestore integration
- Offline data synchronization

### UI and Animation

- Custom animations using Animated API
- Gesture handling with PanResponder
- Material Design inspired components
- Vector icons integration

### Navigation

- React Navigation with custom configuration
- Stack and Tab navigators
- Dynamic headers and navigation options
